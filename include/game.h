/**

 * @brief The state of the game is described by the position of the pieces (i.e. vehicles) on the board and the number of moves since the beginning of the game.
 *
 * The game board is a 6*6 grid. The lower left corner has coordinates (0,0).
 * The piece number 0 represents the "red car" that needs to be moved away from the parking.
 * Its initial position is (0,3).
 * A winning game (state) is when the red car touches the right border of the game board (i.e. when its position is (4,3)).
 *
 * cgame is a pointer toward a constant game.
 * That means that it is not possible to modify the game thanks to this pointer.
